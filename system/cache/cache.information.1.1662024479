Working days means that Saturdays, Sundays or public holidays are not included in this period.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(c) you have a legal obligation to keep the Products in your possession and to take reasonable care of the Products while they are in your possession.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9.9 As a consumer, you will always have legal rights in relation to Products that are faulty or not as described. These legal rights are not affected by the returns policy in this clause 9 or these Terms.

&lt;p&gt;10.1 Your order will be fulfilled by the estimated delivery date set out in the Dispatch Confirmation, unless there is an Event Outside Our Control.

&lt;p&gt;10.5 Delivery will made to the address of the business registered with HETAS on our main registrant database. Please contact HETAS should you wish to change your address, changing your address manually will in the Shop will not result in the products being delivered to that&amp;nbsp;address. This a fraud protection measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. No international delivery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11.1 Unfortunately, we do not delivery to addresses outside the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Price of products and delivery charges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.1 The prices of the Products will be as quoted on our site from time to time. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices of Products are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.2 Prices for our Products may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any order which we have confirmed with a Dispatch Confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.3 The price of a Product includes VAT (where applicable) at the applicable current rate chargeable in the UK for the time being. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your order and the date of delivery, we will adjust the VAT you pay, unless you have already paid for the Products in full before the change in VAT takes effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.4 The price of a Product does not include delivery charges. Our delivery charges are as quoted on our site from time to time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.5 Our site contains a large number of Products. It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Products on our site may be incorrectly priced. If we discover an error in the price of the Products you have ordered we will inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Product at the correct price or cancelling your order. We will not process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you in writing. Please note that if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing, we do not have to provide the Products to you at the incorrect (lower) price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. How to pay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13.1 You can only pay for Products using a debit card or credit card. We accept the following cards: MasterCard, Debit MasterCard, Maestro, Visa Credit, Visa Debit, Electron, Discover, Diners Club International, BC Global Card, DinaCard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Our warranty for the Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15.1 For Products which do not have a manufacturer's guarantee, we provide a warranty that on delivery and for a period of 12 months from delivery, the Products shall be free from material defects. However, this warranty does not apply in the circumstances described in clause 15.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15.2 The warranty in clause 15.1 does not apply to any defect in the Products arising from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) wilful damage, abnormal storage or working conditions, accident, negligence by you or by any third party;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16.3 Subject to clause 16.2, we will under no circumstances whatever be liable to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, arising under or in connection with the Contract for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16.5 Except as expressly stated in these Terms, we do not give any representation, warranties or undertakings in relation to the Products. Any representation, condition or warranty which might be implied or incorporated into these Terms by statute, common law or otherwise is excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. Events outside our control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18.1 We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under a Contract that is caused by an Event Outside Our Control. An Event Outside Our Control is defined below in clause 18.2. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18.3 If an Event Outside Our Control takes place that affects the performance of our obligations under a Contract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) we will contact you as soon as reasonably possible to notify you; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) our obligations under a Contract will be suspended and the time for performance of our obligations will be extended for the duration of the Event Outside Our Control. Where the Event Outside Our Control affects our delivery of Products to you, we will arrange a new delivery date with you after the Event Outside Our Control is over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19. Communications between us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19.1 When we refer, in these Terms, to &quot;in writing&quot;, this will include e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19.2 If you wish to contact us in writing for any other reason, you can send this to us by e-mail or by pre-paid post to us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:shop@hetas.co.uk?subject=From%20TCs%20of%20online%20shop&quot;&gt;shop@hetas.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; or to our address as given on our site.

The provisions of this clause shall not apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents in any legal action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20. Other important terms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.1 We may transfer our rights and obligations under a Contract to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.2 You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree in writing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.3 This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties Act) 1999 or otherwise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.4 Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.5 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.6 If you are a consumer, please note that these Terms are governed by English law. This means a Contract for the purchase of Products through our site and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it will be governed by English law. You and we both agree to that the courts of England and Wales will have non-exclusive jurisdiction. However, if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are a resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20.7 If you are a business, these Terms are governed by English law.
